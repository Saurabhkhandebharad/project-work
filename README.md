_Description_ : A library management system, a student management system, and a bank account management system are software 
applications designed to automate tasks and improve efficiency. The library management system allows librarians to 
manage books, patrons, and transactions efficiently. The student management system helps educational institutions 
manage student information, attendance, academic performance, and other important data. The bank account 
management system allows financial institutions to manage customer account information, transactions, and their 
bank balances. These systems help to streamline administrative tasks, reduce errors, and improve communication or 
customer service. With these systems, institutions can provide a better experience for their users.
