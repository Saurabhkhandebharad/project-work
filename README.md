## Python Projects:
Library Management System, Bank Account Management System, Student Management System with Python and MySQL

_Description_ : A library management system, a student management system, and a bank account management system are software 
applications designed to automate tasks and improve efficiency. The library management system allows librarians to 
manage books, patrons, and transactions efficiently. The student management system helps educational institutions 
manage student information, attendance, academic performance, and other important data. The bank account 
management system allows financial institutions to manage customer account information, transactions, and their 
bank balances. These systems help to streamline administrative tasks, reduce errors, and improve communication or 
customer service. With these systems, institutions can provide a better experience for their users.


## Big Data Project
Unlocking  Valuable  Insights:  Leveraging  AWS  Services  for  E-commerce  Analytics    and  Big Data Processing 

_Description_ : We  analyzed  a  multicategory  e-commerce  store  using  big  data  techniques  on  a  Kaggle dataset.  With  the  help  of  AWS  EC2,  AWS  S3,  PySpark,  AWS  Glue  ETL,  AWS  Athena,  AWS CloudFormation,  AWS  Lambda  and  Power  BI,  we  were  able  to  process  and  analyze  the  data  to identify  trends  and  patterns  that  would  have  been  difficult  to  discover  with  traditional  methods.  Our analysis  yielded  valuable  insights  into  customer  behaviour  and  preferences,  which  can  be  used  by  the  ecommerce  store  to improve  their  business strategies and enhance  customer  satisfaction.
